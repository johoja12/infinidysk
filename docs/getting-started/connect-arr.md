# Connect Radarr / Sonarr

InfiniDysk speaks the SABnzbd API surface \*Arr apps expect. Hostnames below assume a shared Docker network.

The [Setup Guide](setup-guide.md) can collect and test Radarr/Sonarr connections
and displays the download-client values below. Use this page for the complete
manual procedure or troubleshooting.

## Add the download client

In Radarr or Sonarr → **Settings** → **Download Clients** → **Add** → **SABnzbd**:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Name | `InfiniDysk` |
| Host | `nzbdav` (or reachable hostname) |
| Port | `3000` |
| API Key | InfiniDysk **Settings → SABnzbd → API Key** |
| Category | Match categories you configured (e.g. `movies`, `tv`) |

Test the connection. Prefer `addfile` when clients can upload NZB bytes; `addurl` to private indexers needs [Trusted local hosts](../configuration/sabnzbd.md) [since 0.8.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.8.0){ .nzbdav-since }.

### Remove Completed

Enable **Remove Completed** under **Completed Download Handling** on the
download client's edit dialog. Enable **Show Advanced** to see it. The global
**Completed Download Handling → Enable** must also be on. After the \*Arr imports
a release, it removes that release's SABnzbd history entry. InfiniDysk never
deletes mounted content in response: imported library links and `.strm` files
keep working, and Health repair and PAR2 recovery still work.

Keeping the history entry prevents **Remove Orphaned Files** from deleting a
file, even after the \*Arr replaces it with an upgrade or re-grab. Without the
setting, superseded grabs build up until
[SAB history retention](../configuration/maintenance.md) prunes their history
entries while keeping the mounts. Unlinked mounts may then become eligible for
**Remove Orphaned Files**. Health can report them as **Not library linked** in the
meantime. The \*Arr only removes downloads it grabbed, so releases grabbed by
[Profiles](../configuration/profiles.md) are not affected.

## Register \*Arr in InfiniDysk

**Settings → Radarr/Sonarr**:

1. Add Radarr host (`http://radarr:7878`) + API key.
2. Add Sonarr host (`http://sonarr:8989`) + API key.
3. Configure **Automatic Queue Management** for stuck import messages (remove / blocklist / search).

Registered and enabled instances light up the Overview **Arr Health** widget [since 1.2.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.0){ .nzbdav-since }. See [Radarr/Sonarr settings](../configuration/arrs.md).

## Align import paths

| Strategy | InfiniDysk setting | \*Arr / media server |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Symlinks | Rclone mount dir e.g. `/mnt/remote/nzbdav` | Same path must exist inside \*Arr |
| STRM | Completed dir e.g. `/mnt/completed-downloads` + Base URL | The completed-downloads path must exist at the same absolute path inside \*Arr; the media server must reach Base URL |

Enable **Repairs** with a **Library Directory** once paths and \*Arr instances exist — [Repairs](../configuration/repairs.md).

## Rejected compressed archives

InfiniDysk intentionally rejects compressed RAR and 7z archive contents. Direct
streaming and seeking require stored, uncompressed payloads: RAR `m0` or 7z
Copy/store. This is a streaming design limitation, not an application error.
Choose another release with stored archives or direct media files. This restriction
does not apply to video codecs such as H.264 or HEVC, or to the NZB manifest itself.

These rejections are reported through SABnzbd history with `status: "Failed"`
and an explanatory `fail_message`. For downloads grabbed and tracked by Sonarr
or Radarr, that is the normal failed-download signal used for blocklisting and
replacement handling. Enable automatic redownload of failed downloads in the
Arr application's download-client settings to request a replacement search;
interactive-search grabs have a separate automatic-redownload setting.

InfiniDysk does not directly force an Arr search for this rejection. Manually
uploaded NZBs without matching Arr grab history do not trigger that automatic
workflow, and a search can only grab another release if an eligible one is available.
