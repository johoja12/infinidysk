# Multi-provider

Add multiple NNTP accounts under **Settings → Usenet**.

## Routing

- **Pool (default)** - connections shared across enabled providers. Within the same provider type and recovery state, routing prefers remaining data cap (uncapped first), then unreserved connections as a fraction of the configured Provider Connection Limit, then estimated delivery score. Pending requests and transfer/metadata admission limits count against spare capacity. A larger configured pool no longer wins solely because its raw free-connection count is higher. The same comparison orders backup peers after routing reaches their tier. This is not round-robin scheduling and does not guarantee equal traffic or a fixed byte ratio; fully idle ties can keep favoring the same provider. Learned connection limits and transfer caps reduce the available fraction without changing its configured denominator.
- **Cascade** — prefer providers in drag order; fail over down the list. Among providers that still have spare capacity, a thinly-spared primary (at most 25% of its pool free) can yield to an idle same-tier peer. Fully saturated providers are still skipped. Absolute pool width does not outrank configured priority while both providers are healthy.

Optional **Re-probe primary after article miss** (`usenet.cascade.retry-primary-on-miss`, default on) retries the primary once after a clean 430/451 before cascading — useful when providers route across spool nodes. Turn it off to go straight to backups after the first miss.

Each provider has type (pool / backup-only / disabled), SSL, connection limits, optional pipeline depth, and optional **data caps** (auto-pause near the limit).

## Circuit breakers and storage groups

Failing providers are skipped temporarily, for a cooldown that doubles on each consecutive trip up to a ceiling. Both bounds default to 60s and 5 minutes and are set with the `usenet.circuit-breaker.*` config keys. See [Usenet configuration](../configuration/usenet.md). **Storage group** labels mark resellers that share the same upstream storage — after a clean article miss on one, siblings in the group are skipped for that request (connection errors never trigger this).

After three consecutive trips [since 1.5.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.5.0){ .nzbdav-since }, the header alert explains that missing-article checks are paused and asks you to fix or disable the provider in Usenet settings.

Across requests, a bounded TTL **article-miss negative cache** [since 0.9.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.9.0){ .nzbdav-since } remembers definitive misses per provider or storage group so streaming retries are not spent re-probing known-missing articles. Tune TTL and max entries under **Settings → Usenet → Global settings**.

Only group providers that truly share storage and retention policy.
