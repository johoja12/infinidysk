# SABnzbd

SABnzbd-compatible download client API used by Radarr/Sonarr. See also [API compatibility](../features/sab-api.md).

!!! tip "Headless ENV"

    Map any config key in the table to `NZBDAV_CONFIG__...` with the
    [naming algorithm](headless.md#naming-algorithm)
    (`api.categories` → `NZBDAV_CONFIG__API__CATEGORIES`).

| Control | Config key | Default | Effect |
|---------|------------|---------|--------|
| API Key | `api.key` | from `FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY` if unset | *Arr download client auth |
| Categories | `api.categories` | env/`audio,software,tv,movies` | Letters/numbers/dashes |
| Manual Upload Category (upload-time picker [since 1.2.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.0){ .nzbdav-since }) | `api.manual-category` | `uncategorized` | Queue page uploads; default for the category picker beside the Upload NZB button |
| Import Strategy | `api.import-strategy` | `symlinks` | Symlinks (Plex) / STRM (Emby/Jellyfin) |
| Rclone Mount Directory | `rclone.mount-dir` | env `MOUNT_DIR` or `/mnt/nzbdav` | When symlinks |
| Completed Downloads Dir | `api.completed-downloads-dir` | `/data/completed-downloads` | When STRM |
| Base URL | `general.base-url` | `http://localhost:3000` | STRM / adapter absolute URLs |
| Ignored Files | `api.download-file-blocklist` | `*.nfo, *.par2, …` | Glob blocklist for mounts (`*` and `?`) |
| Filter sample videos [since 0.10.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.10.0){ .nzbdav-since } | `api.sample-filter-enabled` | on | Discard videos in sample release subfolders such as `Sample/` [since 1.3.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.3.0){ .nzbdav-since }, even when no main video exists. Filename-only whole-word `sample`/`samples` matches are discarded only when under 20% of the largest video in the NZB. Category and release folder names are ignored. |
| Rename a single video to the release name [since 1.3.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.3.0){ .nzbdav-since } | `api.rename-single-video-to-release` | on | When a job mounts exactly one video, rename it to `{release-folder}{extension}`. Season packs and collisions keep the original name. New imports only. |
| Behavior for Duplicate NZBs | `api.duplicate-nzb-behavior` | `increment` | increment / mark-failed |
| Trusted local hosts [since 0.8.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.8.0){ .nzbdav-since } | `api.addurl-trusted-hosts` | env `TRUSTED_INTERNAL_HOSTS` | SSRF allowlist for private addurl |
| Fail downloads without video or audio | `api.ensure-importable-video` | on | Reject NZBs with no media after configured filtering; failures identify [RAR-inside-7z limitations](../features/archives.md) when applicable. Disabling this permits raw archive mounts, not nested-archive playback. |
| Fail when non-media missing articles | inverse of `api.skip-non-video-on-missing-articles` | skip non-media by default | Media files (video/audio) always fail on missing articles; companion files are skipped unless this is enabled |
| Article health check categories [since 1.2.5](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.5){ .nzbdav-since } | `api.ensure-article-existence-categories` | empty (off) | Per-category STAT checks plus a final direct-media BODY readiness read; may be slow |
| Article health check mode | `api.article-existence-check-mode` | `full` | Full or per-file sampled verification |
| Always send full History | `api.ignore-history-limit` | on | Ignore client history limit |
| Save backup copies of incoming NZBs | `api.nzb-backup-enabled` | off | On-disk `*.nzb` copies |
| Backup location | `api.nzb-backup-location` | — | By category |
| Keep NZB backups (days) | `api.nzb-backup-retention-days` | `30` | `0` = forever |

Queue capacity and admission limits are configured separately under
[Queue](queue.md). The default user agent for retrieving NZBs, including
matched `addurl` requests, is configured under [Indexers](indexers.md).

## STRM sidecar cleanup [since 1.3.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.3.0){ .nzbdav-since }

Generated STRM files are deleted together with their content (history
delete-with-files, health repair, Remove Orphaned Files). Sidecars under the
configured completed-downloads directory never count as library links for
orphan cleanup — even when that directory sits inside the Library Directory.

## Sampled article checks [since 0.10.0](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v0.10.0){ .nzbdav-since }

Categories selected under `api.ensure-article-existence-categories` use a full
article check by default, preserving existing behavior. Set
`api.article-existence-check-mode` to `sampled` to check the first and last
segments plus an evenly spaced selection of middle segments in each important
file. Sampling is applied per file so every file's tail is covered; this catches
common truncated or partially removed releases without a full STAT sweep.

Small files (currently up to roughly 8,000 segments) are still checked in full.
The sampled mode uses the same standard-depth selection as background health
checks. It is a screen rather than a guarantee: urgent repair remains the
backstop if an article disappears later or STAT succeeds while BODY fails.

For selected categories, InfiniDysk also reads the head and tail of direct media
outputs before reporting a successful SAB completion [since 1.2.5](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.5){ .nzbdav-since }. This rejects unreadable
container headers and short reads before Sonarr or Radarr begin import. It does
not replace streaming corruption detection or PAR2 repair: damage limited to
the middle of a release can only be detected when that part is read.

## API-key rotation [since 1.2.5](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/releases/tag/v1.2.5){ .nzbdav-since }

After rotating `api.key`, update the API key in every configured Sonarr/Radarr
download-client entry and use its test action before resuming a bulk search.
Rejected SAB API requests are logged without exposing the key, with failures
for the same mode and category throttled.
