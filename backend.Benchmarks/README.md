# Provider circuit acquisition

`ProviderCircuitBreakerAcquisitionBenchmarks` guards the allocation-free breaker
lease/commit path. It measures only the closed-circuit acquisition path and does
not include the unavoidable wait `CancellationTokenSource` allocated by a
contended end-to-end acquisition. `BeginAndCommitClosedCircuit` must report
`0 B/op`; timing is recorded for comparison but has no machine-specific threshold.

# Backend benchmarks

BenchmarkDotNet timing runs stay manual: they are sensitive to runner
contention and hardware, and timing comparisons never block pull requests.
Deterministic transport and SAB API fields from the report harnesses **are**
compared in CI (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
`.github/workflows/performance.yml`).

Run BenchmarkDotNet from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release
```

Use the same machine and runtime when comparing BenchmarkDotNet results across
UsenetSharp or streaming changes.

## Native-cache catalogue scale (metadata only)

Run the small smoke shape first:

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release -- \
  --native-cache-scale-report --shape smoke --samples 10 \
  --json /tmp/native-cache-scale-smoke.json
```

The full shape represents **50 TB decimal**: 5,000 logical files of 10 GB,
with 11,924,999 synthetic 4 MiB integrity-block records. One final block is
intentionally omitted to check that range queries preserve holes. It creates
**no payload files**, but the real SQLite catalogue and indexes need several
GiB of local scratch space and may take minutes to seed:

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release -- \
  --native-cache-scale-report --shape 50tb --samples 10 \
  --json /tmp/native-cache-scale-50tb.json
```

The report always creates its own unique temporary directory. It never accepts
a production cache or database path, never scans a NAS, and removes its fixture
on completion or cancellation. Ctrl+C requests cancellation; the CLI also
requests cancellation after 15 minutes (an in-progress filesystem call must
return before cleanup can finish). Output JSON uses create-new semantics: choose another
filename to retain and compare a second run. On hosts where native build
auto-detection selects an unsupported Ubuntu RID, add
`-p:RapidYencRuntimeIdentifier=linux-x64` before `--`.

The fixture uses the production schema, triggers, and store APIs. It measures
catalogue reopen, a keyset entry page, aggregate coverage, missing bytes for one
file, a verified-range page, and the bounded pressure-eviction candidate query.
It does **not** perform eviction or claim the synthetic hashes represent real
verified media. Query plans are included to expose accidental table scans or
temporary sorting. `catalogueBytes` includes database/WAL/shared-memory file
lengths; `catalogueAllocatedBytes` reports their physical allocation.

Timing samples run with a warm OS cache. Each measurement reports sample count,
median and maximum wall time, plus total process managed allocation across all
samples (not per-operation allocation). RSS and peak working set include fixture
seeding and runtime overhead. These are manual diagnostics, not CI timing gates,
cold-start guarantees, NAS throughput measurements, or hardware durability
evidence. Compare timings only on the same otherwise-idle host and runtime.

### Recorded scale run

The [2026-09-20 report](Reports/native-cache-scale-50tb-2026-09-20.json)
completed the full metadata shape on Ubuntu 24.04 / .NET 10.0.12. Seeding took
160.8 seconds; the catalogue occupied 2,544,488,448 bytes, final process RSS was
64,323,584 bytes, and peak working set was 76,193,792 bytes. No payload files
were created. All recorded query plans selected indexes; median warm-catalogue
reopen was 1.40 ms and the bounded read-query medians were below 0.34 ms.

This run used the report and store sources through an isolated CLI harness on
a shared development host with concurrent build/test activity. It establishes
the fixture size, measured memory footprint, and indexed-query behavior for
that run; it is not a dedicated-runner performance baseline or production
acceptance result. The fixture was removed after the report completed.

## NNTP decoded BODY (`NntpDecodedBodyBenchmarks`)

This measures the playback decode path in
`UsenetSharp.Clients.NntpYencBodyDecoder`: `NntpLineReader` buffering, NNTP/yEnc
framing, rapidyenc, optional CRC, `PipeWriter` backpressure, and a concurrent
consumer. It does **not** include TLS, providers, archives, or WebDAV.

`YencDecodeBenchmarks.DecodeYencSegment` only exercises `YencStream` and is not
evidence for decoded BODY changes.

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks/NzbWebDAV.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release -- \
  --filter "*NntpDecodedBodyBenchmarks*"
```

The corpus is a fixed-seed payload encoded with yEnc line size 128, NNTP
dot-stuffed, with a single-part `=ybegin` / `=yend` / `.` wrapper. Parameters
are decoded size (4 MiB and 32 MiB) and `YencCrcValidationMode` (`Off` or
`Require`). Compare mean time, decoded MiB/s, and allocations only on the same
machine and runtime. Timing stays manual and is not a PR gate.

On macOS, set `RAPIDYENC_LIBRARY_PATH` to the host `librapidyenc.dylib` (see
`scripts/run-backend.sh`).

## Whole-path loopback NNTP report

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release -- \
  --nntp-whole-path-report --set quick --json /tmp/nntp-whole-path.json
```

This report fills the gap between the decoded-BODY microbenchmark and a
provider-backed run. It starts a separate loopback NNTP server process whose
precomputed yEnc corpus has realistic line wrapping, escaping, dot stuffing,
multipart headers, CRC trailers, and NNTP terminators. Server CPU is recorded
separately; client CPU covers socket framing, UsenetSharp decode/CRC and pipe
handling, the connection/provider wrappers, `MultiSegmentStream`, pooled
article buffers, and optionally an HTTP-like 64 KiB response copy.

`--set quick` is the small deterministic PR gate. `--set sustained` uses
256 × 4 MiB articles, 20 connections, and widths 1/2/4/8; it runs only in the
scheduled/manual performance workflow. Use `--scenario <name>` to investigate
one named scenario. Timing and allocation observations are diagnostic, while
bytes, hashes, BODY counts, callbacks, budget cleanup, and connection cleanup
are deterministic gates.

`--set profile` uses 64 × 4 MiB articles, 20 connections, width 4, CRC, and the
HTTP-like sink copy. It is small enough to profile under a 2-core, roughly 8 GB
container without the client/server loopback corpora exhausting the cgroup.

To compare HTTP response-copy chunks without changing production behavior, run:

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release -- \
  --http-copy-chunk-report --repetitions 5 --json /tmp/http-copy-chunks.json
```

The experiment uses the 256 MiB profile scenario and rotates 64, 128, and
256 KiB candidates across repetitions. It hash-verifies each candidate before
timing, then records every sample plus median and median absolute deviation for
wall time, throughput, client CPU, allocations, and time to first byte. On
macOS, set `RAPIDYENC_LIBRARY_PATH` as described above.

This is a localhost NNTP and HTTP-like sink measurement, not an authoritative
WebDAV deployment result. Use it to select candidates for direct-backend testing
on the target deployment; do not infer a universal throughput gain from it.

`--set cold` compares demand-only and read-start-prewarmed scenarios using
342 × 768 KiB articles (256.5 MiB), 20 connections, width 4,
a 40-article window, 40 ms BODY-response delay, and a 6 MB/s per-connection
bandwidth limit. It delays both the greeting and accepted AUTHINFO reply by
150 ms and reports the time from the first accepted connection to the last
increase in peak active connections. This models connection-ramp latency but
does not exercise TLS handshakes, cipher CPU, provider authentication limits,
or a real network RTT. Use it as a scheduled regression observation, not as a
product throughput prediction.

The committed sustained baseline begins with conservative bootstrap timing
envelopes because its 20 GiB local run is intentionally deferred to the
dedicated benchmark phase. Before treating its timing envelope as a regression
signal, dispatch **Performance** with `rebaseline: true` on the intended
runner; that action replaces only the observed timing envelopes while retaining
the deterministic contract.

The cold bootstrap baseline must likewise be re-established on the intended scheduled runner.
Its wall time, throughput, CPU, allocations, and connection-ramp time are noisy;
decoded bytes, SHA-256, BODY and response counts, callbacks, article-budget
cleanup remain deterministic gates. Peak connection count remains a console
diagnostic because thread scheduling can change it in short scenarios.

The initial loopback scenarios are plaintext. Validated-TLS loopback is
deliberately deferred: UsenetSharp accepts only platform-default trust or a
skip-all switch, and the benchmark must not add a permissive certificate
callback. Its test coverage therefore includes only the negative untrusted TLS
path until an explicit test-CA trust mechanism is designed.

For Linux provider-backed CPU investigation, use
`scripts/run-nntp-cpu-profile.sh`. It writes `0700`/`0600` restricted artifacts,
requires credentials via a private `CURL_CONFIG`, and separates
uninstrumented results from EventPipe and `perf` diagnostics. Profiles and
response bodies can contain sensitive information; do not upload raw artifacts.

## Tool decision

Issue [#854](https://github.com/infinidysk/infinidysk/issues/854) asked to
choose k6, wrk, or a custom .NET client. InfiniDysk uses a **custom in-process
.NET harness** (`--streaming-report` and `--sab-api-report`) because the
deterministic transport fake (`BenchmarkNntpClient`) and pre-seeded SQLite SAB
corpus have to be wired inside the process. A live-socket load tool cannot
see those counters or keep results independent of the network.

Range-probe and tail-probe are the deterministic stand-in for ffprobe's access
pattern (open, header read, tail seek). Full HTTP WebDAV GET percentiles and
SAB `addfile` ingest are out of scope here.

## Repeatable streaming report

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release -- --streaming-report
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release -- --streaming-report --json /tmp/streaming.json
```

It uses generated in-memory segments (`Random(1025)`, 12 × 256 KiB) and the
local segment cache, so it makes no provider connections. The report verifies
payload fidelity while recording cold sequential transport bytes/requests,
first-byte latency, range and tail probes, warm cache re-reads, seeks, and a
zero-filled dead-article read. Compare throughput and latency fields only on
the same machine and runtime, or against the committed envelopes; transport
fields remain deterministic across runs.

## SAB API report

```bash
dotnet run --project backend.Benchmarks -c Release -- --sab-api-report --json /tmp/sab-api.json
```

Directly invokes `GetQueue` / `GetHistory` against a migrated temp SQLite
database (same setup as the SAB limit-zero tests) with a fixed 50-queue /
500-history corpus. Deterministic fields are `rowsReturned`, `totalCount`, and
`dbCommands` (EF command count).

## Regression layers

1. **PR-blocking (no clocks):** xUnit exact-count coverage plus every report
   compared with `scripts/check-performance-baseline.py --deterministic-only`
   against `backend.Benchmarks/Baselines/*.json`. An intentional
   transport-contract or query-shape change must update the baseline JSON in
   the same PR.
2. **Scheduled envelopes:** `.github/workflows/performance.yml` runs each
   report 3× on a cron / `workflow_dispatch` and fails when the median misses
   a floored 3× envelope. Dispatch the workflow with `rebaseline: true` to
   write new baselines and open (never merge) a PR. Locally:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-performance-baseline.py \
  --candidates /tmp/streaming.json \
  --write-baseline backend.Benchmarks/Baselines/streaming-baseline.json
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN`-created re-baseline PRs do not trigger `pull_request` CI;
close/reopen or push to run checks.

## Scenario → meaning

A count change is a transport or query-shape contract change. Update the
matching constant in
`tests/NzbWebDAV.Tests/Streams/RepeatableStreamingBenchmarkCoverageTests.cs`
and/or the committed baseline JSON.

| Scenario | Field going up usually means |
| --- | --- |
| `cold-sequential` `transportRequests` | extra BODY/ARTICLE traffic per byte (lost batching or smaller segments) |
| `cache-prime` `transportRequests` | cache prime is no longer one request per fixture segment |
| `warm-reread` `transportRequests` | segment cache miss on a path that should be warm |
| `range-probe` `transportRequests` | read-ahead widened (or cache skipped) for a mid-file probe |
| `tail-probe` `transportRequests` | tail/header-style probe is fetching extra segments |
| `seeks` `transportRequests` | seek amplification (more articles per scrub) |
| `dead-article` `transportRequests` / `transportBytes` | extra work around a missing article, or a gap that is no longer zero-filled |
| SAB `rowsReturned` / `totalCount` | pagination or filter contract change |
| SAB `dbCommands` | extra round-trips (often N+1) for the same page |
