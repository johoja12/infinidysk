        NzbDAV technical support pack

        This archive contains the current backend in-memory log buffer, a redacted
        active Settings snapshot, runtime information, and aggregate metrics.
        Backend logs are cleared when NzbDAV restarts. Frontend and container logs
        are not included.

        logs/backend.log holds the most recent events of every level, so a busy or
        debug-level install can push older events out of it. logs/warnings.log keeps
        the last 500 warnings and errors separately for that reason - check it first
        when the main log looks like it only contains routine activity.

        environment.json → webdavCounters summarizes WebDAV request health since
        startup: total, failed (5xx), aborted (client closed early, normal on seeks),
        slowFirstByte (GETs whose first byte took over five seconds - genuine
        server-side latency), slowMetadata (PROPFIND/HEAD over five seconds),
        stalledStreams (streams with no body write attempted for over a minute), and
        longStreams (healthy client-paced reads that simply outlived five seconds).
        slow is the sum of the three attention-worthy kinds.
        abortedBeforeFirstByte is the subset of aborted GETs that produced no body
        byte - those point at server-side latency, unlike an ordinary seek abort.
        suppressedSlowWarnings counts slow-warning log lines dropped by the
        per-category throttle, not requests; a high value means the counters above
        are more complete than logs/warnings.log.

        environment.json → queue.inProgress lists every in-flight import with its
        current stage, how long that stage has been running, and cumulative queue
        semaphore wait. Use it to tell NNTP work apart from finalize-lock wait,
        metadata blob writes, or the SQLite commit.

        environment.json reports CPU and GC pause figures, thread pool occupancy, and
        per-provider connection-pool state with lifetime churn. Read cpu.rolling and
        gc.rolling first: a background sampler records them every few seconds, so
        their peaks span the whole time the backend has been running rather than the
        moment the pack was collected. peakWhileReading only counts samples taken
        while a read was in flight, which tells playback cost apart from container
        startup, a queue import or a health sweep. cpu.onDemandSample is a half-second
        window measured while this pack was written - packs are usually collected
        after the symptom has passed, so treat it as a footnote, not the headline.

        environment.json → healthCheckGate reports the process-wide verification
        budget: its effective limit, active operations, and queue/background waiters.
        Use it to distinguish a saturated health budget from provider latency.

        environment.json → healthChecks identifies active background workers and the
        last 32 finished attempts, with file IDs/names, phases, elapsed times, last
        progress timestamps, and process-lifetime started/finished counts. Repeated
        IDs in recent attempts can reveal rapid rechecks. History resets on restart;
        Finished means the worker returned, not that the media was healthy. Outcome
        and health-result history are separate. Missing progress is not zero progress.

        Prefer the cumulative GC counters (totalPauseDurationMs, totalAllocatedBytes,
        collection counts) over pauseTimePercentage, which reflects only the most
        recent collection.

        stream-traces/ is included while developer stream tracing is enabled or while
        a stopped capture is retained for one hour (Settings → Support, or
        STREAM_TRACE_EVENTS). Tracing is opt-in, memory-only, and resets on restart.
        Check manifest.json → streamTraces for capacity, retained/overwritten counts,
        and overflowed. When the ring wraps, stream-traces/OVERFLOW.txt explains how
        much of the reproduction was discarded; sessions.json reports eventsComplete
        per session because session summaries can outlive their retained events.
        RangeOpen includes fileName to correlate opaque /.ids/ paths with media titles.
        It also exports accumulated stall totals even before the request ends. These
        counters include completed timing observations, not the unelapsed remainder
        of a currently blocked operation. Do not add RangeOpen and RangeEnd totals
        together: they refer to the same range. A missing RangeEnd may mean the request
        is still open or that tracing stopped before it ended; check capture completeness.
        RangeEnd events carry stall attribution for the range that just finished:
        connWaitMs (waiting for an NNTP connection),
        providerWaitMs (waiting for provider response headers), bodyDrainMs (reading
        article bodies), consumerWaitMs (playback starved waiting for prefetch), and
        clientWriteMs (blocked writing to the player). They overlap, because segments
        are fetched concurrently, so read them as shares of the range rather than a
        breakdown that sums to its duration.

        Each RangeEnd also reports fetches, the number of segment fetches attributed to
        that range. providerWaitMs is an aggregate across concurrent fetches, so it can
        exceed wall clock; compare providerWaitMs / fetches (average provider wait) and
        providerWaitMs / elapsed RangeOpen-to-RangeEnd time (implied concurrency) with
        the configured pool size. Attribution is by the range that started each fetch,
        including fetches that finish after an aborted RangeEnd, so late work is not
        billed to the next range. Pair RangeOpen and RangeEnd by rangeGeneration when
        requests overlap or finish out of order.

        RangeEnd.bytesServed counts successful response writes for that request only,
        not the session total. RequestEnd follows handler cleanup and shares its
        rangeGeneration. firstByteMs measures from entry to WebDAV observability
        middleware through the first successful nonempty response write, including
        store lookup and stream opening. requestDurationMs includes handler cleanup;
        transferEndedMs marks the end of body copying, and cleanupMs is the difference.
        cancelledAtMs marks the first observed client cancellation relative to request
        entry. cancellationTimingSource is callback, transfer-end, or request-end;
        teardown observations cover cancellation callbacks superseded by request
        completion. These are not transport-level disconnect timestamps.
        cancellationToCompletionMs measures from that observation through handler
        cleanup and can understate the full cancellation delay, especially for
        transfer-end or request-end observations. cleanupMs does not include the
        remaining lifetime of a shared upstream stream retained after reader detachment.
        Missing firstByteMs means no successful body write. RequestEnd is available
        only when tracing was active at request entry and a range was opened. Shared
        upstream fetches are not attributed to individual ranges: absent fetch/provider
        totals on shared reads do not mean zero upstream work or zero provider latency.

        Trace connWaitMs and the connection pool's GateWaitMs are not comparable. Trace
        stalls are scoped to read sessions captured while tracing was active; pool churn
        counters are process-wide and cumulative, so they also include queue imports and
        health sweeps. On a scan-heavy install the two legitimately differ by orders of
        magnitude.

        metrics/recent.json → latency24Hours projects one-minute response, pool-wait,
        and permit-wait histograms into five-minute buckets. Percentiles are bucket
        upper bounds (not exact sample percentiles). Only successful NNTP responses are
        counted; body-drain time is excluded from response. Compare:
        - high response with low pool-wait/permit-wait → provider/server latency
        - high provider pool-wait → that provider's connections are saturated/churning
        - high streaming/queue permit-wait → that workload's connection cap is saturated
        - high trace consumerWaitMs with low values in all three → prefetch/consumer pacing

        The archive deliberately excludes database files, backups, blobs/NZBs,
        environment files, session/API key files, crash dumps, and segment-cache
        data. Credentials, API keys, tokens, URL credentials and sensitive URL query
        values are redacted. IP addresses are pseudonymized.

        File names, filesystem paths, account usernames, DNS hostnames, and
        non-secret URL paths can remain for troubleshooting. Share this archive only
        with trusted NzbDAV support.

        configuration-effective-streaming.json is the only configuration document
        designed for public benchmark extraction. It contains resolved, allowlisted
        streaming settings and no credentials, hostnames, paths, or provider
        identities. metrics/segment-cache.json is likewise a public-safe cache
        snapshot. The rest of this archive, including configuration.json, logs, and
        environment.json, remains a private trusted-support artifact and must not be
        published with benchmark results.
